### This is my first real test to real job and introduction to jquery.

- For the layout, they provided me with a screenshot of the site (the logo and pictures were replaced by me to maintain confidentiality).
- As a technical task, I needed to add a few jquery sliders to the page.

  - semantic tags
  - BEM naming methodology
  - improvisational adaptive
  - I implemented the opening / closing of the menu without js

> This site is falling apart, but I look at it today with a smile
